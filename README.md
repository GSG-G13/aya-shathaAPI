# The Description of project:
An anime website is a platform that enables users to browse through an extensive collection of anime and provides detailed information about each title, including the synopsis. Additionally, users can access animated GIFs of their preferred anime.

# The User journey:
The user journey on the anime website starts with a welcome page that greets the user upon opening the site. From there, the user can proceed to the search page, where they can search for any anime they desire. Once the user initiates the search, the site will display relevant information about the anime they searched for, such as the title and synopsis. After viewing the anime details, the user can access animated GIFs of the anime that appeared in the search results.
